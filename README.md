# Real-Time Image Classification


This is a project in the Deep Learning course [DD2424](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2424?l=en) at the Royal Institute of Technology.

## Abstract

Deep networks are growing deeper and require more energy resources. Previous research has shown that the deep learning field will stop progressing if contributors do not produce lighter and efficient network architectures. This study utilizes MobileNet, the state-of-the-art network for mobile devices, to classify images of fruits and vegetables, and compares its performances to networks with more extensive architectures. Networks were trained from randomly initialized weights and Transfer Learning using ImageNet weights. MobileNet trained with Transfer Learning produced a top-1 accuracy of 96.8% and performed like the more extensive network architectures. This study uses the top-1 MobileNet predictor to conclude a real-time image classification app.

## Test The Program

* Navigate to the repository

* Setup a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv fruits
```

```bash
source fruits/bin/activate
```

* Install Required Utility Packages

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test the Real-Time Image Classification App

* Run,

```bash
python3 main.py --realtime
```
----
### Make a prediction

* Run,

```bash
python3 main.py --predict --img_path 'MyPath/ToThe/Image'
```
-----
> **_NOTE:_** Replace MyPath/ToThe/Image with the path to your image to classify. Default: data/test_data/apple.jpg

### Train and evaluate a network
This part requires an NVIDIA GPU.

#### Generate the dataset

Send a request to Majdj@kth.se to obtain the dataset folder, because the dataset is larger than 100MB.

* Replace data/FRUITS folder with the one obtained from majdj@kth.se.

* Run,

```bash
python3 main.py --generate_data
```

#### Training with randomly initialized weight

* Run,

```bash
python3 main.py --train --model "mobilenet"
```
#### Training with Transfer Learning

* Run,

```bash
python3 main.py --train --model "mobilenet" --transfer_learning
```
> **_NOTE:_**  Training supplements: scheduler, pass --scheduler; fine tune a pre-trained model, pass --fine_tune

----

#### Evaluate the network

* Run,

```bash
python3 main.py --evaluate --model "mobilenet" --path 'MyPath/To/Weights'
```
> **_NOTE:_**  If the model was trained with Transfer Learning, pass the --transfer_learning tag.
